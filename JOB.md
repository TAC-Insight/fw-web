# Come work with us!

## We are hiring a TS/JS/Svelte Dev

We just broke ground on a rewrite of our [Fast-Weigh web ui](https://tacinsight.com).

This rewrite decouples the frontend and backend. It is currently an old .NET 4.x ASP.NET monolith.

We are moving the backend to an API that can be shared across our web ui, native desktop app, and iOS/Android apps.

We are rethinking the UX and design from the ground up, so this role will have a lot of freedom in a brand new code base.

## What you'll be working on

The new frontend is being written in Svelte / SvelteKit / TailwindCSS.

You will be responsible for everything within this frontend application (code, design, tests).

This is a rewrite of a quite large application. ~100 screens with lots and lots of components and authorization logic.

You will be encouraged to open source components as much as you possibly can to contribute back to the Svelte ecosystem.

## About TAC Insight

TAC Insight is the company's name. We make Fast-Weigh (and a couple of other things but Fast-Weigh is all you'll be involved in).

We have ~20 employees. Of those ~20, 4 are on the dev team.

1 native desktop dev / mobile dev
1 backend dev / db admin
1 frontend / integrations / product lead
1 CTO / PM

This is not a typical grind-it-out startup job. We're bootstrapped, profitable, maintain reasonable work/life balance expectations, and plan on being around for a long time.
